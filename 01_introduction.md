audience?
---------

- everybody, raise your hands.  lower your hand if:
	- you've worked with rails
	- you've worked with an MVC web application framework
	- you've worked on a user-facing web application

why framework?
--------------

- stop re-inventing the wheel
	- sharing libraries, 'nuff said
- defines conventions, making it easier to bring on new devs

the rails arch.
---------------

- MVC Architecture and the lifecycle of an incoming HTTP request to a Rails app
- Maybe some Ruby/Object Oriented basics

rails philosophies
----------------

- follows conventions
- suggests technologies (eg. sass/less, coffeescript)
- promotes automated testing

don't get overwhelmed
----

- throw away your first app
    - don't write tests
    - don't use sass if you don't know it
- use scaffold generator until you learn conventions

when you get stuck
----

- look at the [official guides][1]
- ask questions on [SO][3] (currently 88,451 questions)

learn more
----

- be aware of new releases, read ["Riding Rails"][2]
